# Tree traversal methods:

* **In-order traversal:** left, root, right`(root in between left and right)`
* **Pre-order traversal:** root, left, right`(root at the beginning, then left and right)`
* **Post-order traversal:** left, right, root`(root at the end)`

BFS: Breadth First Search, goes level wise `(goes each level and process from left to right)`

DFT: Depth First Search, goes depth wise `(searched using the above traversal methods in depth)`
